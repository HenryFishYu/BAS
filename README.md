# A simple BAS Calculate

### Introduce
### Attention:You can't get the real result with this but only a reault approaching to the real result.
> This can calculate a quadratic equation,get the limit or approach anynumber
> 
>eta means how fast the step reduce
>
>step means the Centroid moving weight
>
>accuracy means the distance between (leftX)xl and (rightX)xr (accuracy*step should bigger than 0.05,maybe 0.1 is much more better,or you have to adjustment eta and step,but the largest step is 1)
>
>defaultX means the begin position,because a quadratic equation might have two x with the same y
>a,b,c means a*x*x+b*x+c
>
>times means how many times we will calculate(the large times is and the small accuracy is , we will get a result much more approach the real result
>
> ### The Chinese introduce will be finished later
